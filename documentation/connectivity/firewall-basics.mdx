## **What the Hivenet Agent is**

The Hivenet Agent is a lightweight network tool that:

- Helps your instance discover and connect with others on the network
- Manages secure tunnels for HTTPS endpoints
- Enables peer-to-peer communication without needing a central gateway

If your instance’s public URL isn’t working—or if SSH fails unexpectedly—the Agent might be blocked or misconfigured.

## **Which ports the Agent needs**

To work correctly, the Agent uses:

- **Port 4001 (TCP/UDP)** – For peer discovery and swarm networking
- **Port 4443 (TCP)** – For secure tunneling and HTTPS exposure

These should be open on your machine or network if you're running the Agent directly or using advanced features.

## **When you need to open these ports**

Most users on Hivenet Compute don’t need to manually open ports unless:

- You're behind a corporate firewall or router with strict rules
- You're contributing resources (via Contribute) or hosting long-running HTTPS endpoints
- You want to ensure best-case network performance with external tools

<Tip>
  Test your setup on a mobile hotspot to see if network restrictions are the cause.

## **How to check if the Agent is working**

| Where you’re running          | What to do                                             |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inside a Compute instance** | Open the logs:\`journalctl -u hivenet-agent --no-pager |

<Note>
  Root is disabled on all Compute containers. Commands that require sudo will fail.
</Note>

## **Firewall troubleshooting tips**

- Allow outgoing connections on ports 4001 and 4443
- Temporarily disable firewall apps or try switching to a less restricted network
- Restart the instance and check if the error persists
