## When you need port forwarding

If your app says something like:

```
App started at http://127.0.0.1:7865
```

…it means the web interface is only accessible _inside_ the Compute instance. You’ll need to forward the port to use it in your local browser.

This is common with:

- Fooocus
- Stable Diffusion UIs
- Jupyter Notebook
- Gradio / Streamlit apps

## Step 1 – Set up local port forwarding

In your Windows Terminal, run:

```
ssh -L 7865:localhost:7865 ubuntu@<your-instance-id>.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

Replace:

- `7865` with the actual port your app uses
- `<your-instance-id>` with your Compute instance ID

Now open http://localhost:7865 in your browser.

**Tip:** Keep the terminal open! If the SSH session closes, the connection breaks.

## Step 2 – Get your port and IP details

If you’re not sure which port your app uses:

Run this from inside your instance:

```
whoami hostname -I
```

Then test your app inside the VM:

```
curl http://localhost:7865
```

If that works, you can forward the port.

## Step 3 – Trying the public Hivenet URL

You can try visiting:

```
https://<your-instance-id>-8888.tenants.hivecompute.ai
```

This is a public-facing URL Hivenet creates automatically for instances.

However, it only works if:

- Your app listens on port 8888
- It's bound to `0.0.0.0` (not just `localhost`)
- It's currently running

If it doesn’t work or shows “Bad Gateway,” fall back to SSH port forwarding.

## Bonus: Forward multiple ports

You can add more `-L` flags to forward several ports at once:

```
ssh -L 7865:localhost:7865 -L 8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@<your-instance-id>.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

Great for debugging or running multiple services.
