## What causes this error?

When you paste an SSH key into the Compute dashboard and see “Invalid SSH key,” it usually means:

- You pasted the **private** key instead of the public key
- You copied only part of the public key or included extra spaces/line breaks
- Your key type isn’t recognized (e.g., an unsupported format)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify you’re using the public key">
    1. Open your `.ssh` folder
    2. Find the file ending in `.pub` (for example, `id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa.pub`).
    3. Right‑click the `.pub` file → **Open with** → Notepad.
    4. **Select and copy** the entire single line, starting with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa` and ending with your email or comment.

    <Warning>
      Don’t open or copy the file without `.pub`. That’s your private key!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regenerate your key if needed" stepNumber={2} titleSize="p">
    If you can’t find a `.pub` file or suspect it’s corrupted, create a fresh pair:

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    - Accept the default file location or give it a custom name (e.g., `id_hivenet`).
    - When prompted, set a passphrase (optional but adds security).

    Then repeat Step 1 with the new `.pub` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste carefully into the dashboard">
    1. In the Compute dashboard, go to **Add SSH key**.
    2. **Click inside** the SSH key field—avoid pasting into any other box.
    3. **Paste** your copied public key in one go (Ctrl+V).
    4. Click **Save** or **Add key**.

    <Tip>
      If you see line breaks or extra spaces, click inside the field and use backspace or delete.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common pitfalls

**Hidden newline characters:** Some editors add a newline at the end. Make sure the pasted text ends with your key comment, not an empty line.

\*\*Wrong key type: \*\*Compute supports `ssh-ed25519` and `ssh-rsa`. ECDSA keys may not work.

\*\*Mixing up accounts: \*\*If you have multiple keys, verify you copied the one linked to the current Compute account.

## Test your key locally (optional)

You can test that your key is valid by connecting to a known host (like GitHub):

```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If GitHub accepts the key, it’s formatted correctly.
