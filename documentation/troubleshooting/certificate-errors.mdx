Sometimes a browser shows a certificate warning when you open the Compute console or API. This feels alarming, especially when everything worked fine the day before. These errors almost always come from something on the user's network intercepting HTTPS traffic, like corporate firewalls, antivirus software, or SSL inspection tools that replace certificates during traffic scanning. The good news is that your data and our certificates are safe. The issue sits between your device and the internet.

Most cases come from corporate firewalls or antivirus programs that inspect encrypted traffic. They replace the real certificate with one of their own. Browsers react to this by warning you that the connection doesn’t match what they expected.

This page explains why it happens, how to confirm it, and how to fix it.

## What a valid certificate should look like

Compute uses certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.

A correct certificate shows:

- **Issuer:** Let’s Encrypt (R12)
- **Root:** ISRG Root X1
- A valid, trusted status in the browser

If you see a different issuer (such as a company name or an antivirus vendor), your connection is being intercepted and rewritten locally.

## Quick checks

Start with simple tests to narrow down the issue.

### 1. Try a different network

Use mobile data or a home Wi-Fi connection.

If the warning disappears, the issue is caused by the corporate network or firewall.

### 2. Try a private/incognito window

This rules out browser extensions.

### 3. Restart the browser

A clean session can remove cached certificate states.

## Check the certificate in your browser

1. Open the page showing the warning.
2. Select the padlock icon in the address bar.
3. Open **Certificate** or **View certificate**.
4. Check the **Issuer** and **Root**.

If the issuer is **not** Let’s Encrypt, something on your network is intercepting SSL.

<Warning>
  If the certificate issuer is unfamiliar or tied to a security appliance, do not proceed until the connection is trusted again.
</Warning>

## Test the API endpoints

These endpoints let you confirm whether the certificate is passed through correctly.

### Health check

A valid request to the health endpoint should return **200 OK**:

```
https://api.hivecompute.ai/health
```

### API root

Visiting the root should return **401 Unauthorized**, which is expected:

```
https://api.hivecompute.ai/
```

<Note>
  If either of these endpoints triggers a certificate warning, the certificate is being replaced on the client’s network.
</Note>

## Common causes of certificate interception

The most frequent sources are:

- Corporate firewalls performing SSL inspection
- Antivirus software scanning encrypted traffic\
  (Kaspersky, ESET, Avast, and similar tools)
- Security appliances configured to rewrite certificates
- Network security policies that intercept HTTPS by default

These systems act as a “man-in-the-middle” proxy and install their own certificate authority. Browsers detect the mismatch and show warnings.

## How to fix the issue

### For individual users

Check your antivirus settings for features such as:

- “HTTPS scanning”
- “SSL inspection”
- “Encrypted traffic scanning”

Disable these features or add exceptions for Hivenet domains:

- `*.hivenet.com`
- `console.hivecompute.ai`
- `api.hivecompute.ai`

### For corporate users

If you are on a managed network, contact your IT team and request that the above domains be whitelisted or excluded from SSL inspection.

Provide them with:

- A screenshot of the certificate details
- The exact domain you attempted to access
- The time of the error
- The expected certificate issuer (Let’s Encrypt / ISRG Root X1)

## When to contact Hivenet Support

If the certificate appears valid but you still cannot access the console or API, contact [**support@hivenet.com**](mailto:support@hivenet.com) with:

- The full error message
- Browser and operating system
- Whether the issue changes on a different network
- The certificate issuer as shown in the browser
- Any relevant screenshots

Support can confirm whether the issue is local or if something else needs investigation.
