  <Step title="Click the copy icon next to the ID.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste it into your message when contacting support.">

</Steps>

<Tip>
  Your instance ID is not the same as the instance name. The name is chosen by you, while the ID is automatically generated and unique.

<Warning>
  Do not confuse the instance ID with your **User ID** or **SSH key**. Support usually only needs the instance ID.
