When you create a Compute instance, you choose how it runs: as a **container **or as a **virtual machine** (VM). Both options can run real workloads. The difference is how much control you get over the operating system and how you manage software.

If you’re unsure, start with a container. It’s usually the quickest path to getting work done, and you can switch by creating a new instance later if you run into OS limits.

## Quick rule of thumb

Choose a **container** if you want a fast, managed runtime for scripts, apps, and models.

Choose a **virtual machine** if you need full OS control, sudo access, kernel-level settings, or a specific Linux distribution.

## Containers in Compute

Containers are designed for most common workloads. They’re a good fit when you want to run code and ship a working environment without managing the operating system.

A container-based instance is usually the right choice when you’re:

- Running scripts, apps, or APIs
- Doing standard ML workflows with typical dependencies
- Serving models and inference workloads with a supported template
- Prioritizing a simple setup and quick startup

A few things to know up front:

- Containers don’t support root access. Commands that require `sudo` won’t work.
- System-level changes are handled through templates rather than modifying the OS directly.

Note: If your workflow depends on installing OS packages manually, running system services, or changing low-level settings, you’ll likely want a VM instead.

## Virtual machines in Compute

Virtual machines are for workloads that need a traditional server experience. You get full control of the operating system, including the ability to install and configure software at the OS level.

A VM is usually the right choice when you’re:

- Installing system packages with your OS package manager and managing services
- Running software that expects full OS behavior
- Working with tools that require deeper system access
- Needing a specific Linux distribution or custom OS image
- Depending on kernel-level configuration or system drivers

With a VM, you can expect to work more like you would on a typical Linux server. That flexibility can be worth it, but it also means you’re taking on more responsibility for OS setup and maintenance.

## Common scenarios

If you’re running a Python script, a small service, or a straightforward app, start with a **container**.

If you’re serving an LLM using a standard inference setup, a **container** is often enough. Choose a **VM** if your setup requires OS-level customization, system services, or a specific distro.

If you need to install system packages, configure services, or rely on `sudo`, choose a **VM**.

If you’re not sure and you just want the simplest path to “it works,” choose a **container**.

## What changes between containers and VMs

Here’s what users notice most in practice:

- OS control: containers have limited OS control, VMs give full OS access
- Installing software: containers rely on templates and app-level dependencies, VMs use standard OS package tools and configuration
- Setup speed: containers tend to be faster to get running, VMs are more flexible but require more setup
- Compatibility: containers cover most workflows, VMs are better when your workload depends on OS-specific behavior or a specific distribution

Tip: If you hit a wall with OS-level requirements, that’s a strong signal you should move the workload to a VM.

## Switching if you picked the wrong one

You can switch approaches by creating a new instance of the other type and redeploying your workload.

Before you switch, it helps to write down:

- The template or base image you used
- Your application dependencies and install steps
- Any environment variables or secrets your workload needs
- The commands you use to run your workload

If you’re moving from a container to a VM, plan for OS-level setup that you may not have needed before (packages, services, users, and startup scripts).

[VERIFY]: If the product supports converting an existing instance from container to VM (or the reverse), document that here. If it doesn’t, keep the guidance as “create a new instance.”
