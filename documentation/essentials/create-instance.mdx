This article will walk you through the basics of Compute, Hivenet's GPU-powered cloud service built for AI, ML, and other high-performance workloads.

You'll learn how to create an account, launch your first instance, connect to it, and manage your usage.

<Info>
  ## **What you’ll need**

  - A Hivenet account
  - An SSH key (public) to connect to your instance
  - Optional: a payment method to add credits later

<Note>
  Compute instances on Hivenet run in secure containers. They behave like lightweight virtual environments, but they’re not full virtual machines. Containers start faster and use fewer resources, which keeps pricing low and performance steady. Full VMs are coming soon for users who need full OS control.
</Note>

## **Create your account**

To get started:

1. [Sign up for Compute](https://auth.compute.hivenet.com/u/login?state=hKFo2SA2TU1QNHZhNk9kM3lTX2FCMi1yMW5OaWJZZlFpUDZvOaFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIHM5QjI1Uk1ZQTdPSlBEbm9kZEVTcUtWR3ZyMTRIQV8to2NpZNkgYnhOQ09YRXJ4R2VDNTJMSXdxQ25pSllQQWdSd3lyc3U).
2. Log in to access your dashboard.

Your dashboard is where you'll manage your projects, launch instances, and track usage.

<Note>
  Compute uses a separate account from the one you may already have for Hivenet storage and other services. We know that’s not ideal, and we’re actively working on unifying accounts across the platform.
</Note>

## **Launch an instance**

Once you’re in the dashboard:

- Go to the **Instances** page.
- Click **Launch new instance**.

- Under **Location**, choose a region.
- Under **Type**, select your instance type (GPU or vCPU).
- Choose a **Size** (Small, Medium, Large).
- Upload your **SSH key**.
- Click **Deploy**.

Your instance will now appear on the **Instances** page with its current status.

<Note>
  Root access is disabled on Compute containers. Use a Custom Template for system packages.
</Note>

## **Connect to your instance via SSH**

After launching, here’s how to connect:

- On the **Instances** page, find your running instance.
- Click **Connectivity options**.
- Copy the provided SSH command.
- Paste it into your terminal to connect.

<Tip>
  You can configure your `~/.ssh/config` file for faster access later.
</Tip>

## **Stop or terminate an instance**

To avoid using up credits, stop any instances you’re not actively using.

- **Stop**: Pauses your instance (you can restart it later).
- **Terminate**: Permanently deletes your instance and all data on it.

<Warning>
  Terminating an instance will erase everything on it. Be sure to back up any important files first.
</Warning>

## **Add credits to your balance (optional)**

To add credits to your account, follow these steps:

- Open the **Billing** page from the left-hand menu.
- Click **Add credits**.
- Choose an amount and complete the Stripe checkout flow.

## **What’s next?**

Now that you’re set up, you can start running AI models, experimenting with machine learning, or deploying custom workloads—**on demand and on your terms.**
