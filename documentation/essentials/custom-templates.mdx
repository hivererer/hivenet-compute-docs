Custom templates let you save and reuse container configurations for your compute jobs. Instead of manually setting up the same environment each time, you can create a template once and launch new instances from it whenever you need.

## Why use custom templates

- **Save time**: No need to retype registry paths, variables, or commands every time.
- **Stay consistent**: Make sure all your instances use the same base image and environment.
- **Reuse securely**: Keep sensitive values as secrets so they’re injected only at runtime.

## Creating a new template

You can create a custom template directly in the Compute console when launching a new **container** instance. Select **New template** under the _Pick a template_ step.

### General settings

- **Name** – Choose a clear, descriptive name for your template.
- **Instance type** – Select whether this template is for a **GPU** or **CPU** instance.
- **Visibility** – Templates are **Private** by default (only you can see and use them). Public templates will be available in the future.

### Container configuration

- **Registry** – Provide the full path to your container image (for example, `docker.io/library/nginx:latest`).
- **Registry credentials** – Enable this option if you’re using a private registry that requires authentication.

### Environment variables

Define environment variables as `KEY=value` pairs. You can add:

- **Variables** – Standard environment values.
- **Secrets** – Sensitive keys (e.g., API tokens). Secrets are injected securely at runtime.

### Instructions for base images

When building your template, you can use the provided Hivenet base image and setup script:

```dockerfile
FROM 993cz8u0.c1.gra9.container-registry.ovh.net/hive-compute-public/base-ubuntu:latest
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/setup_instance.sh"]
```
