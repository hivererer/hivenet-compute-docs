With the Start/Stop feature in Compute, you can control when your instances are active. If you need to take a break, save on costs, or just pause a project, you can stop an instance and resume it later—no need to recreate anything.

## View your instances

- Go to your **Compute** dashboard.
- Select the **Instances** tab.
- Here you'll see all of your instances—running or stopped—with details like uptime, resource usage, and hourly cost.

To create a new instance, click **Create new instance** in the top-right corner.

## Stop an instance

To stop billing and pause usage:

- Click the **•••** next to the instance you want to stop.
- Select **Stop** from the dropdown.

The instance status will update to **Stopped**, and you will no longer be billed. Your configuration and data will be saved.

## Start a stopped instance

To resume activity:

- Find your stopped instance in the **Instances** tab.
- Click the **•••** next to it.
- Select **Start**.

## If resources aren't available

If the network can’t allocate resources immediately, you’ll see a message asking you to try again later. Your data and settings will remain safe while you wait.
