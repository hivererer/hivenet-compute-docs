With the Start/Stop feature in Compute, you can control when your instances are active. If you need to take a break, save on costs, or just pause a project, you can stop an instance to temporarily pause it and stop compute charges. 

When you start it again, the instance resumes from its previous state, as long as it hasn’t been automatically terminated.

## View your instances

- Go to your **Compute** dashboard.
- Select the **Instances** tab.
- Here you'll see all of your instances—running or stopped—with details like uptime, resource usage, and hourly cost.

To create a new instance, click **Create **on the sidebar or in the top-right corner.

## Stop an instance

To stop billing and pause usage:

- Click the **•••** next to the instance you want to stop.
- Select **Stop** from the dropdown.

The instance status will update to **Stopped**, and you will no longer be billed. Your configuration and data will be saved.

<Warning>
  **Important: stopped instances are temporary**

  When an instance is stopped, it isn’t kept indefinitely.\
  If an instance remains stopped for more than 5 days, it is automatically terminated.

  Once terminated, the instance and its data can’t be recovered. To keep an instance, make sure to start it again within that time window.

  If an instance was stopped for more than 5 days, it may have already been terminated and won’t be available to start.
</Warning>

## Start a stopped instance

To resume activity:

- Find your stopped instance in the **Instances** tab.
- Click the **•••** next to it.
- Select **Start**.

## If resources aren't available

If the network can’t allocate resources immediately, you’ll see a message asking you to try again later. Your data and settings will remain safe while you wait.
