The **Settings** menu lets you adjust your preferences, manage SSH keys, and request account deletion. Here’s what you can do.

## Accessing settings

Click on the hamburger menu next to your avatar (**⋮**). From here, you can manage the following options:

- **Settings**
  - **SSH**: Add or update your SSH key.
  - **Delete account**: Submit a request to delete your account.
- **Theme**: Switch between **System**, **Light**, and **Dark** modes.
- **Language**: Choose between available interface languages.

## Theme

You can choose how the interface looks:

- **System**: Matches your operating system’s theme.
- **Light**: Bright background with dark text.
- **Dark**: Dark background with light text.

This setting affects only the appearance of the Compute interface.

## Language

You can switch the interface language at any time. Currently supported:

- **English**
- **French**

<Note>
  Language choice affects the UI only. It doesn’t change your account details or technical settings.
</Note>

## SSH key

Your SSH key is used to securely access every new instance you deploy.

- To update your key, paste a new value into the SSH field and click **Modify**.
- The key will automatically apply to all future instances.

<Warning>
  Replacing your SSH key will not affect existing running instances. Update keys manually on those servers if needed.
</Warning>

## Delete account

You can request to [permanently delete](/documentation/account-billing/delete-account) your Compute account.

- Click **Request to delete account** to submit your request.
- Account deletion is **irreversible**.
- Any unused credits will be lost.

<Danger>
  Deleted accounts cannot be recovered. Make sure you’ve withdrawn any important data and used up your credits before submitting your request.
