Hivenet GPU instances pair NVIDIA cards with a fixed amount of vCPU, ECC RAM, and disk so you can launch fast without tuning every knob.

### Available GPU families

- **NVIDIA RTX 4090** — 24 GB of GDDR6X memory per GPU
- **NVIDIA RTX 5090** — 32 GB of GDDR7 per GPU

<Note>
  “RAM” in the tables refers to system memory (ECC).

### Quick tips

- **VRAM vs RAM:** VRAM affects maximum model size per GPU; system RAM supports your runtime and dataset loaders.
- **Throughput:** Scale from 1 → 8 GPUs for higher parallelism.
- **CPU host:** Nodes use **AMD EPYC 7713** processors.
