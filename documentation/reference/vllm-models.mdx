The vLLM template lets you spin up an inference server in minutes. Pick a model from the catalog or provide your own weights.

### Available models

- **Falcon3 3B**
- **Falcon3 Mamba-7B**
- **Falcon3 7B**
- **Falcon3 10B**

> These ship as ready-to-run choices in the vLLM template. You can also mount your own models from storage or pull from public registries.

### Coming soon

- **Llama** family
- **Mistral** family
- **Qwen** family
- **GPT-OSS**

### How to deploy (quick)

1. Create instance → choose **vLLM inference** template.
2. Select a **model** and size (GPU or CPU as needed).
3. Launch. The server exposes an HTTP endpoint by default; add ports/SSH if required.

> Host hardware: AMD EPYC 7713; GPU sizes listed in [**GPU types and sizes.**](/articles/reference/gpu-types)
