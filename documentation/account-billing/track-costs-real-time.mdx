Go to your Hivenet dashboard and navigate to **Dashboard \> Billing**

There, you’ll find:

- **Current session duration**
- **Estimated cost in EUR**
- **Breakdown by instance**

<Tip>
  Costs are updated in near real time while your instance is running.

## **How Compute pricing works**

Hivenet bills Compute by the minute, based on:

- GPU type (e.g., 1x RTX 4090 vs. 2x)
- Uptime (start time until instance is stopped or terminated)
- Optional extras (storage, bandwidth)

You’re only charged while the instance is active.

## **Stop vs. terminate: what’s the difference?**

- **Stop**: Pauses your session. You won’t be charged for compute time, but storage costs may still apply.
- **Terminate**: Deletes the instance completely. No further charges.

Stopping is ideal if you plan to restart soon. Terminate if you're done. [Learn more.](/documentation/essentials/stop-terminate-instance)

## **Edge cases: when costs might spike**

If something looks off (like being billed for multiple sessions), check:

- Did you accidentally create multiple instances?
- Was your instance left running overnight?
- Did your browser tab not update the stop status?

Reach out to support if your usage doesn’t match what’s billed.
