Compute with Hivenet uses prepaid credits. You add funds first, then we deduct usage in real time while your instances run. You can see your **balance** and your **current spend rate (EUR/h)** at any time in **Billing** .

<Note>
  Charges apply only while an instance is running. Stopping or terminating an instance stops compute charges.
</Note>

## Find billing in the app

From the left sidebar, select **Billing**. You’ll see:

- **Balance** (EUR)
- **Current spend rate** (EUR/h)
- **Add funds** cards
- **Auto top-up** controls
- **Billing details** _(opens Stripe — coming soon in-app)_
- **Transaction history** _(coming soon)_

## Add funds

1. Go to **Billing → Add funds**.
2. Choose an amount (e.g., **€20**, **€50**, **€100**, **€500**).
   - If this is your first time on this page, you will also see the current first-purchase bonus (for example, “Get +€10/€40/€125/€250 for free”). This is applied **once per account** and may vary by offer.
3. Click **Complete payment** and finish checkout in Stripe.
4. Your **Balance** updates as soon as the payment clears.

<Tip>
  If a prepaid card fails repeatedly, try a single larger top-up rather than several small ones.
</Tip>

## Turn on auto top-up

Auto top-up helps you avoid interruptions.

1. After your first successful top-up, go to **Billing → Auto top-up**.
2. Toggle **Enable auto top-up**.
3. Set a **balance threshold** and a **reload amount**. We’ll add credits automatically when your balance drops below the threshold.

<Note>
  Auto top-up appears only after you’ve added credits at least once.
</Note>

## How charging works

- **Granularity:** per-second billing; no hourly minimums.
- [**Start/stop**](/documentation/essentials/start-stop-instances)**:** charging starts when an instance is **Running** and stops when it’s **Stopped** or **Terminated**.
- **Low/zero balance:** instances won’t start without enough credit. If your balance runs out, running workloads stop to prevent negative charges. Add credits and start again.

<Info>
  **Example**\
  If an instance runs for 12 minutes 20 seconds, you’re billed for **740 seconds** at that GPU’s active price.
</Info>

## Payment methods, receipts, and taxes

- **Payment methods:** Major credit/debit cards via Stripe (availability varies by country).
- **Receipts:** Stripe emails a receipt for every successful top-up.
- **Taxes/VAT:** Applied where required based on your billing details in Stripe.
- **Currency:** Balances and prices are shown in **EUR**.

<Note>
  **Billing details** and **Transaction history** are labeled _Coming soon_ in the Billing page. Until then, use Stripe receipts for your records. If you need a consolidated statement, contact Support.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting payments

- **Card declined:** Check funds, complete any 3-D Secure prompt, or try another card.
- **Prepaid cards blocked:** Your bank may block online/international payments by default. A single larger top-up often works better.
- **Charged but not credited:** Refresh the page after a minute. If it’s still missing, contact Support with the date, amount, and the last four digits of your card.
