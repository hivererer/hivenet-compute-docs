## Why think twice?

- All running **and** stopped instances will be terminated.
- Every disk, snapshot, and backup tied to Compute will be wiped.
- Any remaining credits vanish when the account does.
- You’ll be logged out the moment deletion completes.

<Warning>
  This action is immediate and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

If you just need a breather, you can [pause or shut down instances instead](/documentation/essentials/stop-terminate-instance). Feel free to [contact Support](mailto:support@hivenet.com) to explore alternatives.

## What you’ll need

- Access to the Hivenet account you want to delete.
- Any data you care about **already downloaded** to a safe place.
- A quick check that you’ve used (or are willing to lose) any Compute credits.

## Steps to delete your Compute account

1. Sign in to Compute and select **Account → Settings**.
2. Scroll down to **Delete account**.
3. Click **Request to delete account**.
4. In the confirmation window, tick every box to confirm you understand the impact.
5. Select **Delete account**.

That’s it. Your Compute account and data are gone for good. We’ll log you out right away and send a confirmation email.

## What happens next?

- Your Compute resources are scrubbed from our network within minutes.
- Any pending deployment or billing processes tied to Compute are canceled.
- Your Hivenet **Store** files and other services stay untouched. (Want to delete those too? [Here is how](https://help.hivenet.com/en/articles/164662-how-can-i-delete-my-hivenet-account).)
- You can reopen Compute any time by signing in and creating a new workspace—just note that previous data and credits are not recoverable.

<Note>
  For now, your Compute account is separate from your main Hivenet account. Deleting Compute won’t affect your access to cloud storage, file transfer, or other services unless requested separately.
</Note>

## Need another option?

If high costs or unused capacity are the issue, consider:

- Stopping or deleting individual instances instead of the whole account.
- Downgrading instance sizes.

Our Support team is always happy to talk through the best path forward.
