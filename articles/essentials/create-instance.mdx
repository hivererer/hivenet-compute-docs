This article will walk you through the basics of Compute, Hivenet's GPU-powered cloud service built for AI, ML, and other high-performance workloads.

You'll learn how to create an account, launch your first instance, connect to it, and manage your usage.

<Info>
  ## **What you’ll need**

  - A Hivenet account
  - An SSH key (public) to connect to your instance
  - Optional: a payment method to add credits later

## **Create your account**

To get started:

1. [Sign up for Compute](https://auth.compute.hivenet.com/u/login?state=hKFo2SA2TU1QNHZhNk9kM3lTX2FCMi1yMW5OaWJZZlFpUDZvOaFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIHM5QjI1Uk1ZQTdPSlBEbm9kZEVTcUtWR3ZyMTRIQV8to2NpZNkgYnhOQ09YRXJ4R2VDNTJMSXdxQ25pSllQQWdSd3lyc3U).
2. Log in to access your dashboard.

Your dashboard is where you'll manage your projects, launch instances, and track usage.

<Note>
  Compute uses a separate account from the one you may already have for Hivenet storage and other services. We know that’s not ideal, and we’re actively working on unifying accounts across the platform.
</Note>

## **Launch an instance**

Once you’re in the dashboard:

- Go to the **Instances** page.
- Click **Launch new instance**.

- Under **Location**, choose a region.
- Under **Type**, select your instance type (GPU or vCPU).
- Choose a **Size** (Small, Medium, Large).
- Upload your **SSH key**.
- Click **Deploy**.

Your instance will now appear on the **Instances** page with its current status.

<Note>
  Root access is disabled on Compute containers. Use a Custom Template for system packages.
</Note>

## **Connect to your instance via SSH**

After launching, here’s how to connect:

- On the **Instances** page, find your running instance.
- Click **Connectivity options**.
- Copy the provided SSH command.
- Paste it into your terminal to connect.

<Tip>
  You can configure your `~/.ssh/config` file for faster access later.
</Tip>

## **Stop or terminate an instance**

To avoid using up credits, stop any instances you’re not actively using.

- **Stop**: Pauses your instance (you can restart it later).
- **Terminate**: Permanently deletes your instance and all data on it.

<Warning>
  Terminating an instance will erase everything on it. Be sure to back up any important files first.
</Warning>

## **Add credits to your balance (optional)**

To add credits to your account, follow these steps:

- Open the **Billing** page from the left-hand menu.
- Click **Add credits**.
- Choose an amount and complete the Stripe checkout flow.
