## What you’ll need

- A Compute instance created via the Hivenet dashboard
- Your SSH private key
- Windows Terminal or another SSH-capable terminal (like PowerShell)
- A configured `config` file (optional but helpful)

## Step 1 – Get your instance ID

When you create a Compute instance, you'll receive a unique ID that looks like:

```
ba184ade-84ed-4047-90bb-ca3b76e84246
```

Use this to build your SSH HostName:

```
ba184ade-84ed-4047-90bb-ca3b76e84246.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

## Step 2 – Connect

**Fastest option (recommended)**

1. In the dashboard go to **Instance → Connectivity options → SSH**.
2. Click **Copy to terminal to connect**.
3. Paste the command into your terminal and hit Enter.
   - The command already includes your instance ID and user.
   - It only works if you’ve added the “Add this to your SSH/config file” snippet shown right below the command.

**Build the command yourself**

```
ssh ubuntu@<your-instance-id>.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

Replace `<your-instance-id>` with the ID you copied in Step 1.

\*\*If you’ve created a Host entry in \*\*`~/.ssh/config`

```
ssh hivenet
```

## Step 3 – Use a ProxyCommand if needed

Some connections require a jump host (a "bastion") for access. If you're getting timeouts, try this:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o "ProxyCommand ssh bastion@ssh.hivecompute.ai %h" ubuntu@<your-instance-id>.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

**Note:** You may need to replace `id_ed25519` if your key has a different name.

This creates a secure tunnel from your machine to the instance through Hivenet’s bastion.

## Step 4 – Confirm your connection

If everything works, you'll land in a Linux shell on your instance. You can now:

- Install packages
- Clone repos
- Run workloads
- Start your apps (like Fooocus, Jupyter, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

- **Terminal closes immediately** — Run your SSH command from an open terminal window instead of double-clicking a file.
- **Connection timed out** — Add `-v` to get detailed output and check for network issues.
- **Permission denied** — Check that your SSH key matches what you uploaded in the Compute dashboard.
- **Bad Gateway** — You may be trying to access a web app before it’s started. Use `curl localhost:<port>` to confirm it's running.
