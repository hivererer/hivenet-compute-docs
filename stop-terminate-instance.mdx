On your **Instances** page, the three-dot menu (`⋮`) next to each instance offers two choices: **Stop** or **Terminate**. Seeing them side-by-side can be confusing—especially when one of those buttons can wipe an instance for good.  

They might seem similar, but the results couldn’t be more different. One pauses your instance and keeps it around. The other deletes it entirely—no undo.

This short guide breaks down what each option does, when to use it, and how to run the action step-by-step.

## Where to find these actions

1. Go to **Compute → Instances**
2. Find the instance you want to manage
3. Click the **three-dot menu** (`⋮`) on the right
4. Choose **Stop** or **Terminate**
5. Confirm your choice in the pop-up dialog

You’ll need to tick some boxes before confirming Terminate—just to be sure you know what you're doing.

## Stop vs. Terminate

| Action        | What it does                     | Can you restart it later? | Keeps config? | Charges stop?                              | Auto-expires?         |
| :------------ | :------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Stop**      | Pauses the instance              | Yes, within 5 days        | Yes           | Yes                                        | Yes, after **5 days** |
| **Terminate** | Deletes the instance permanently | No                        | No            | Yes (all charges stop if you delete disks) | Yes, immediately      |

## ⚠️ Stopped instances are not forever

Stopping an instance pauses it, but only temporarily. If you don’t restart it within **5 days**, it will be **automatically terminated**—and that means:

- The instance is deleted
- All data is lost
- There’s no recovery option

This includes anything stored on the system disk. If it’s stopped and you forget about it, it will be gone.

## When to use **Stop**

Use Stop when you:

- Need to temporarily pause an instance
- Want to save on Compute charges for a bit
- Plan to restart it soon

Once stopped, the instance will show as **Stopped** in your list. To avoid losing it, just make sure you start it again within 5 days.

## When to use **Terminate**

Terminate is for when you're done with the instance—no return. Choose it when:

- You’ve completed a job and want to clean up
- You no longer need the instance or its data
- You want to completely stop all charges

Before the instance is deleted, you’ll be asked to confirm that:

- All tasks will stop
- All data will be wiped
- This cannot be undone

Once terminated, the instance disappears from your dashboard and cannot be recovered.
