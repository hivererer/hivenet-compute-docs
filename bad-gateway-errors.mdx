## What these URLs are

When you create a Compute instance, Hivenet generates a temporary web URL:

```
https://<instance-id>-8888.tenants.hivecompute.ai
```

These are public links to help you access web interfaces like:

- Jupyter notebooks
- Fooocus
- Stable Diffusion UIs
- Dashboards running on port 8888

##  Why you might see "Bad Gateway"

Seeing a Bad Gateway error usually means one of these:

- **Your app isn’t running yet**
- **The app is listening only on \*\*\*\***`localhost`, not on `0.0.0.0`
- **The app is running on the wrong port** (e.g. 7865 instead of 8888)
- **HTTPS rate limit issues** (rare, but happens with repeated rapid reloads)

##  Quick fixes

Here’s how to troubleshoot:

1. **Make sure your app is up**

   ```
   curl http://localhost:8888
   ```

   You should see HTML or a JSON response, not a timeout or error.
2. **Check the port** Your app must run on port 8888 for the Hivenet URL to work.
3. **Update binding address** Some apps default to:

   ```
   127.0.0.1:8888
   ```

   You need:

   ```
   0.0.0.0:8888
   ```

   Add `--host 0.0.0.0` if you're launching the app from the command line.
4. **Restart the app if needed** After changing host or port configs.

##  When in doubt, forward the port yourself

If you can’t get the public link working, use SSH port forwarding:

```
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@<instance-id>.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

Then open http://localhost:8888 in your browser. This is usually more reliable.
