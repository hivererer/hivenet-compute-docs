Sometimes, you just want a fast way to run Python code or data science notebooks without fiddling with the command line or SSH keys. With Compute, you can launch a Jupyter notebook straight from your browser and start working right away. This is handy for anyone who prefers a graphical interface or needs to get up and running quickly.

 Below, you’ll find a simple walkthrough on how to spin up a Jupyter notebook with Compute, open it in your browser, and even use the built-in terminal for command-line tasks. There’s also a video tutorial at the end, so you can follow along visually.

##  What you’ll need

- A Hivenet account with access to Compute
- An active Compute balance
- A web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or Safari recommended)

## How to launch and access a Jupyter notebook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Compute instance">
    - Sign in to your Hivenet account and go to the Compute dashboard.
    - Click **Create new instance**.
    - Select your desired resources (GPU, CPU, RAM, and storage).\
      ​_(You can start small—just make sure it fits your workload.)_
    - Under **Connectivity**, toggle on **Jupyter Lab Notebook**.
    - Finalize your settings and launch the instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Notebook endpoint">
    - Once your instance is running, look for the three-dot menu next to it.
    - Select **Connectivity options**.
    - Copy the **Notebook endpoint** URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the notebook in your browser">
    - Paste the Notebook endpoint URL into a new browser tab.
    - Your browser may show a security warning because of a self-signed certificate. This is normal—just confirm you want to proceed.

    <Tip>
      Most browsers let you click “Advanced” and then “Proceed anyway.”
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start working in Jupyter">
    - The Jupyter notebook interface will load in your browser.
    - Create or upload a new notebook and start coding as usual.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Bonus) Use the built-in terminal">
    - In Jupyter, you can open a **Terminal** tab to run command-line tasks. No need for SSH!
    - This is perfect for quick file management or package installs right from your browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What’s next?

- Remember to shut down your kernels and stop or terminate your instance when you’re done to avoid extra charges.
