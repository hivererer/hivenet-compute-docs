## What you’ll need

Make sure you have:

- An active Compute instance
- Your **instance ID** (from the Hivenet dashboard)
- Your **private SSH key** (.pem or .ed25519 file you downloaded)
- A Mac with Terminal (you’ll find it in Spotlight)

##  Step 1: Find your instance ID

In the Hivenet dashboard, copy your instance ID (looks like `ba184ade-84ed...`). You’ll use this when connecting.

##  Step 2: Open Terminal

Press **Cmd + Space**, type `Terminal`, and hit **Return** to open it.

##  Step 3: Prepare your SSH key (recommended for security)

To keep things tidy and secure, move your downloaded key to your Mac’s SSH folder. 

 In Terminal, run these commands one by one:

```
mkdir -p ~/.ssh                # Make the SSH folder if it doesn’t exist
chmod 700 ~/.ssh               # Lock the folder so only you can open it
mv ~/Downloads/your-key.pem ~/.ssh/     # Move your downloaded key
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/your-key.pem  # Lock the key file
```

 Replace `/path/to/your-key.pem` with the actual path to the key you downloaded.

## Step 4: Connect to your instance

Copy your **instance ID** from the Hivenet dashboard. Then run:

```
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-instance-id.ssh.hivecompute.ai
```

1. Replace `/path/to/your-key.pem` with your key file location
2. Replace `your-instance-id` with the full ID (something like `ba184ade-84ed...`)
3. The default username is **ubuntu**

## Step 5: Accept the connection

On first connect, you’ll see a message like:

```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Type `yes` and hit **Return**.

##  You're in

You’ll land in your instance’s terminal, ready to install packages, run apps, or start a Jupyter notebook.

<Tip>
  If you already use 1Password, you can store and use SSH keys directly—no need to manage files or worry about permissions. [Here’s how SSH with 1Password works](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/).

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Permission denied (publickey)?**
  - Make sure the path to your `.pem` file is correct and that it’s set to `chmod 600`.
- **Connection times out?**
  - Try restarting your instance. Some networks block SSH—if this keeps happening, ask us for help with an alternate connection method.
