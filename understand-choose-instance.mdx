## What makes up a Compute instance?

Each Compute instance is a container built for high-performance workloads. When you create one, you’re choosing a mix of hardware and settings that define how it performs.

<Note>
  Root access is disabled on Compute containers. Use a Custom Template for system packages.
</Note>

Here’s what’s included:

- **GPU(s):** The core of your instance. Choose from NVIDIA RTX 4090s — up to 8 per machine — ideal for training AI models, running ML workloads, 3D rendering, and other GPU-heavy tasks.
- **vCPUs & RAM:** These are automatically matched to your GPU setup, so everything runs smoothly without manual tweaking.
- **Storage:** Every instance comes with fast local SSD storage. Persistent or expandable storage isn’t available yet, but it’s coming soon.
- **Region:** Pick where your instance runs —  (for now, we support France or the UAE). Your choice can affect latency and data residency.
- **Billing type:** We currently support on-demand billing (pay-as-you-go). You get high availability without long-term commitments.

<Tip>
  You don’t pay when your instance is off. Terminate it when you're done to stop billing.
</Tip>

## How to choose the right instance

The right setup depends on what you’re working on. Here are a few tips to guide your decision:

- **Training AI models?** Each RTX 4090 has **24 GB of VRAM**. Pick the number of GPUs that matches your model’s size and memory needs.
- **Not sure what to choose?** That’s okay. Reach out via the chatbot or join us on Discord — we're here to help.

## Managing your instance from the dashboard

Once it’s live, your instance is fully under your control:

- **Start/Stop** anytime
- **Monitor** usage, uptime, and cost in real time
- **Terminate** the instance when you're done — billing stops as soon as it’s off

<Info>
  Instances are billed per second, so you’re never stuck paying for idle time.

## How to connect to your instance

As soon as your instance is ready, you’ll get:

- A public **IP address**
- **SSH credentials**
- GPU details (so you can run `nvidia-smi` and check your setup)

You can connect using your terminal with a standard SSH command:

```
ssh [your-username]@[your-instance-ip]
```

You can use your terminal or a GUI SSH client — whichever you prefer.
